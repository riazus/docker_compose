Bonus part(done):

‚Ä¢ Set up redis cache for your WordPress website in order to properly manage the
cache.

‚Ä¢ Set up a FTP server container pointing to the volume of your WordPress website.

‚Ä¢ Set up Adminer.

‚Ä¢ Set up a service of your choice that you think is useful. During the defense, you
will have to justify your choice (In my "Inception" it is Portainer).

‚Ä¢ Create a simple static website in the language of your choice except PHP (Yes, PHP
is excluded!).

For example, a showcase site or a site for presenting your resume.
